## Aim and motivation

<pre>
If we can predict homeless people’s behaviour, we will able to provide help and services with these people. 
Among all methods, machine learning techniques have been proved that they are able to improve the decision making in the health-care sector (Chen et al., 2019). 
Session-based recommenders  are useful when we have user interaction history  that they can learn based on the short-term interaction (Wang et al., 2022). These methods are emerging in the healthcare system to recommend the next-treatment recommendation (Haas, n.d.). 
Our Aim is to predict the event within a session.  
We used Word2vec model (Rong, 2016) that that capture the semantic similarities to predict the next event.

## Data set

<pre>
* In this work we used the MLB public dataset to represent the medical data. 
* The features in this dataset are correlated with the features that we will see in the real dataset. That’s why this dataset represents health care dataset.
* The data contains, a series of discreet events, including medical tests that can come back with good or bad results or vital crash that needs emergency or intense medical aid. 
* Another type of events in our database are stretched over a period. These events have starting and ending point

## To deal with imbalanced Classes, we used Weighted Random Sampler:
